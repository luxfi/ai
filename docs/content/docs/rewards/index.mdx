# Rewards System

Lux AI miners earn LUX tokens for contributing GPU compute to the network. This guide explains the reward system and how to maximize earnings.

## Overview

The reward system incentivizes:

- **Quality**: High-quality inference outputs
- **Availability**: Consistent uptime
- **Performance**: Fast response times
- **Reliability**: Successful request completions

## Reward Formula

Miner rewards are calculated as:

```
Reward = Base_Rate × Quality_Multiplier × Performance_Multiplier × Availability_Bonus
```

Where:
- `Base_Rate` = Token reward per 1000 tokens generated
- `Quality_Multiplier` = Trust score (0.5 - 1.2)
- `Performance_Multiplier` = Latency bonus (0.8 - 1.2)
- `Availability_Bonus` = Uptime bonus (1.0 - 1.1)

## Token Economics

### Supply

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Supply | 1,000,000,000 LUX |
| Mining Allocation | 30% (300M LUX) |
| Emission Schedule | 10 years |
| Block Reward | Variable |

### Emission Curve

```
Year 1: 60M LUX (20%)
Year 2: 48M LUX (16%)
Year 3: 38M LUX (13%)
Year 4: 30M LUX (10%)
Year 5+: Declining curve
```

### Current Rates

| Model | Tokens/LUX | Est. Hourly (RTX 4090) |
|-------|-----------|------------------------|
| llama-3.3-8b | 50,000 | 5-10 LUX |
| llama-3.3-70b | 10,000 | 15-30 LUX |
| mistral-7b | 50,000 | 5-10 LUX |
| embeddings | 200,000 | 2-5 LUX |

*Rates vary based on network demand*

## Staking Requirements

### Minimum Stake

| Tier | Stake | Benefits |
|------|-------|----------|
| Basic | 100 LUX | Mining access |
| Standard | 500 LUX | Priority routing |
| Premium | 2,000 LUX | Higher reward multiplier |
| Enterprise | 10,000 LUX | Dedicated allocation |

### Stake Benefits

Higher stakes provide:
- Priority request routing
- Reward multiplier bonuses
- Slashing protection
- Governance voting weight

## Trust Score Impact

Your trust score directly affects rewards:

| Trust Score | Reward Multiplier |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 99-100% | 1.2x |
| 95-98% | 1.0x |
| 90-94% | 0.9x |
| 80-89% | 0.7x |
| Below 80% | 0.5x |

### Improving Trust Score

1. **Consistency**: Provide identical outputs for identical inputs
2. **Speed**: Meet latency requirements
3. **Uptime**: Minimize downtime
4. **Verification**: Pass attestation challenges

## Claiming Rewards

### Automatic Claims

Rewards accumulate in your miner account and can be claimed anytime:

```bash
# Check pending rewards
lux-ai rewards

# Output:
# Pending: 234.56 LUX
# Last claim: 2024-01-15
# Next estimate: ~45 LUX/day
```

### Manual Claim

```bash
# Claim all pending rewards
lux-ai rewards claim

# Claim to specific address
lux-ai rewards claim --to lux1abc...
```

### Auto-Claim

Configure automatic claiming:

```yaml
# ~/.lux-ai/config.yaml
rewards:
  auto_claim: true
  claim_threshold: 100  # Claim when >= 100 LUX
  claim_address: lux1abc...
```

## Fee Structure

### Network Fees

| Fee Type | Rate |
|----------|------|
| Claim fee | 0.1 LUX |
| Transfer fee | 0.01 LUX |
| Unstaking | 0.5 LUX |

### Slashing

Misbehavior results in stake slashing:

| Violation | Penalty |
|-----------|---------|
| Failed attestation | 1% stake |
| Malicious output | 10% stake |
| Repeated failures | Up to 50% stake |

## Reward Optimization

### Hardware Optimization

```bash
# Check performance metrics
lux-ai benchmark

# Output:
# Model: llama-3.3-8b
# Throughput: 45 tokens/sec
# Latency: 23ms first token
# Est. daily: 180 LUX
```

### Model Selection

Choose models based on your hardware:

| VRAM | Optimal Models | Est. Daily |
|------|---------------|------------|
| 8 GB | 7B quantized | 50-100 LUX |
| 12 GB | 7B full precision | 80-150 LUX |
| 24 GB | 7B + 70B quantized | 150-300 LUX |
| 48 GB+ | All models | 300-600+ LUX |

### Timing

Network demand varies:

| Time (UTC) | Demand | Rewards |
|------------|--------|---------|
| 00:00-06:00 | Low | 0.8x |
| 06:00-12:00 | Medium | 1.0x |
| 12:00-18:00 | High | 1.2x |
| 18:00-24:00 | Peak | 1.3x |

## Monitoring Earnings

### Dashboard

```bash
# Open web dashboard
lux-ai dashboard
```

### API

```bash
# Get earnings via API
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  https://api.lux.ai/v1/miner/rewards
```

### Prometheus Metrics

```
luxai_rewards_earned_total
luxai_rewards_pending
luxai_rewards_claimed_total
luxai_reward_rate
```

## Tax Considerations

Lux AI provides earnings reports:

```bash
# Generate tax report
lux-ai rewards report --year 2024 --format csv
```

Report includes:
- Date/time of each reward
- Amount in LUX
- USD value at time of receipt
- Transaction hashes
